# Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino

## Notes

This is a work in progress English translation of the sword and buckler plays from Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino. I'm making use of my basic understanding of Italian, various online translation resources, and trying to infer some of the meaning behind some of the more linguistic flourishes in the original text.

If I get something wrong, or if you have a better translation or interpretation for anything included, feel free to submit an issue or a PR.

## XCIX

### The things of importance I desire to say

I dare to tell you every secret on
Coming to the half swords in fencing,
stand in both simple and usual ways.
The false to the false can happen
Or the dritto to the dritto or _gliamo dritto_.
Either one can be the agent or the patient.
Whoever is more shrewd and masterful will be the victor

### i stretta a mezza spada

If you are falso on falso at the half sword
turn a falso to their right temple,
step with your right foot indirectly to the inside and quickly push a riverso with a cruel blow (a beat?)

The counter to this stretta for your pleasure:
When they turn the falso to catch the temple,
step with your right foot directly to their right and throw a riverso tondo to their right temple from across

### ii stretta

Also a technique happening firmly at the half sword.
Deliver a kick to the groin with the right foot following a trailing foot pass
to give a fendente dritto to the head.

The counter is to intercept the target.
To the kick you are owed,
forcefully crash the buckler.
You parry the kick, and they cannot deliver the fendente.

### iii stretta

This is the stretta with the left foot forward.
Pass with the right and deliver a feight falso,
to outwit your enemy.
Deliver a dritto slice to the head,
Make your right foot dance to your right,
thrust the edge to the head by pushing a mandritto
between their weapons.
(Trabaccaratti) drieto as Hercul was (strong molinello mandritto??)

The counter is this: When they pretend to throw the false, do not move at the sight. When they throw the sword to draw the edge on your head, you will make his life sad by taking a large passing step, and following after with the trailing foot. The right one makes you intuitive,
that is, with sword in arms then strike a riverso, nor can you fail if you don't give him pain

### iv stretta

Also to the face, that is, with the extended wrist.
Throw a feint falso to the face,
Let your sword rain with an extended molinetto, bringing the trailing foot well to your right. Rather, push a riverso to their right temple after having beat. For the counter, wait to defend yourself from this strike.

When they perform the manacing falso,
lock the sword together with the buckler
While they pass with the trailing foot
to deliver the proud riverso
Pass with your trailing foot somewhat
obliquely and to their right
cut a falso to guarda di inrare,
their riverso won't be worthwhile.
