# Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino

<summary>Notes</summary>
This is a work in progress English translation of the sword and buckler plays from Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino. I'm making use of my basic understanding of Italian, various online translation resources, and trying to infer some of the meaning behind some of the more linguistic flourishes in the original text.
If I get something wrong, or if you have a better translation or interpretation for anything included, feel free to submit an issue or a PR.

<summary>Framing</summary>

```
Doue e Franco e compagni il dir mimena,
Che ritrouor Chironne in un boschetto .
Chironne in vista i giudico gagliardi,
Per canto imbraccio il scudo, e prese i dardi.

Domandol nome il tutto gli narrórnoi
E come gli mandaua allui Mercurio
```

```
Doue and Franco and comrades reveal to me,
that Chironne was found in a grove.
With Chironne's insight, I judge them to be nimbly disposed of body,
and so covering well with the shield, and gripping the darts.
I inquired his name, they told me the tale, and how
Mercurio had commanded them to him.
```

This is how the story leads into the section on the sword lessons, establishing Chironne as the fencing instructor and the sons of Minos as the students.

Introduction to the mezza spada
</summary>

```
Disse Chironne, io non faro soggiorno,
Ma ne l'imprese gravi mai non furio.
Voglio ciascun di voi far prima adorno
Nello schermireze, e fieui bono alcurio ,

Che quādo un homo ha grāde arte e possan
Il se puo dir che ogni altro al Modo auáza .
```

```
So says Chironne, I will not follow fashions,
so never undertake these grave matters with fury.
I wish for each of you to be first decent
in fencing, and be fierce, strong, and proud
As when one has good art and might,
they may learn these additional forms.
```

Achiallino states he won't follow the format used by other teachers, and instructs students to take this shit seriously and not to lose their temper.

He also states the plays should be used by a fencer with knowledge and confidence in Bolognese style fencing, which is clear from the lack of explanations of the basic cuts, guards, and terms throughout.

```
Piglia la spada in mano col brocchiero
Leggiadro col pie dritto va in traverso
Dal dritto lato tuo destro еe mainero
Accioche tu non par schermitor perso,
Passando per parer piu vago e fiero/
E far il gioco piu polyco e terso.
Tocca il brocchier col falso di la spada,
E la spada in guarda alta sa che vada.
```

```
Take the sword and buckler in hand
Step with your right foot traversing
to the right side in this manner
Additionally, so you aren't lost in fencing,
Pacing, in my opinion, is most elusive and proud,
and the play will be smooth and polished.
Touch the buckler to the false of the sword,
and your sword in high guard, as you go by.
```

A few important takeaways from this paragraph that Achillino feels are worth mentioning. We're instructed to stand in oblique right foot forward guards, and assured that learning tempo is both difficult and extremely important to polishing our fencing. We are also told to keep our sword in high guards when in presence, and guard the inside of our hand with the buckler.

```
Se dir volesse il gioco a parte a parter
I passi, i colpi, i tocchi, i falsi, i dritti,
lo vergarei ben piu di mille charte.
Basta i secreti grandi io tharro ditci
Quanti ne sono qualı in tutta larrer
Che questi sono stati mei profirti.
Vsanza e а far ire assalti in questo gioco,
Sel ne tocco uno ogniun torni al suo loco.
```

```
To teach the game piece by piece,
from the steps, the touches, the strikes, the false and the true.
I could write well over a thousand papers.
Sufficient great secrets I valiantly tell you.
Largely they are as the whole art.
that these situations you stand to benefit.
Use and do the three assaulti to this range,
with their touch each one accounts for their place
```

Achillino is reiterating he is not teaching from basics, but is teaching techniques at what is considered the cruicial distance in fencing.

The "three assaulti" refer to the long plays, or flourishes done from the _gioco largo_, though none are in this tretise, but we can assume they are common in the Bolognese tradition. Achillino instructs us to use these to reach the _mezza spada_, then switch to the appropriate technique based on the situation.

```
Le cose de importancia io voglio dire
Ardisco dir chio dico ogni secreto .
Giungendo a mezza spada nel schermire,
Starli in dui modi solo e consuero ,
Fil fallo con fil fallo puo aduenire ,
O fil dritto con dritro, hor giamo driero .
Ciascun eller puo agente e patiente.
Chi fie piu accorto e Maestro fia vincente .
```

```
The things of importance I desire to say:
I dare to tell you every secret
on coming to the half swords in fencing,
Standing in two fashions simple and common.
The false can come to the false,
or the dritto to the dritto, now already behind.
Either one can be the agent or the patient.
Whoever is more aware and masterful will be the victor
```

Finishing up the intro, Achillino tells us the mechanics of playing in the _mezza spada_. We can be crossed at the false edge or at the true edge. Either we or our opponent can act first as the agent, or counter that action as the patient. The last line indicates the most important thing is our situational awareness, which lets us know _which_ technique to employ, and second to be masterful, or practiced, to actually _use_ the techniques.

## Falso con Falso

	<summary>i. Stretta</summary>

### Agente

```
Se sei falso con falso a mezza spada
Voltagli un falso ne la destra tempia.
El tuo pe destro indieto presto vada
e tra un reverso spinto e sie botta empia.
Sel contra di tal stretta far ti aggrada
```

```
If you are falso on falso at the half sword,
You turn a falso to the right temple.
Quickly pass to your right hand,
and thrust a pushed reverso and it will strike wicked
if the counter of such a stretta pleases you.
```

I read this play as starting in _right coda lunga alta_, throwing a false edge cut to the opponent's face, and should they counter the cut strongly, using the energy from their parry to cut around to _guardia entrare_ on the right, and passing with the left foot to thrust.

Achillino specifies to "thrust a pushed reverso", which I have taken to mean a true edge push-cut with the palm down. Think a very small reverso tondo while extending the hands forward with the whole body behind it.

### Patiente

```
Voltando il falso che chi toglie stempia,
Va col pie dritto al suo dritco e un reverso
Tondo alla drita tempia i da a traverso.
```

```
As the turn of the falso that which distempers
Go with right foot to their right and a reverso
tondo to the right temple given across
```

As the agent turns the false edge to provoke a defensive reaction, step to their outside with the right foot and attack in preparation with a reverso tondo, which crosses back over the line to your right. To get the power required, weight your left foot with a hip turn while bringing the sword to reverse head guard, then strike the tondo while stepping into measure with the right foot and follow with a triangle step back to _right coda lunga alta_.

### Agente

```
Item essendo a mezza spada anchora
Managli un calcio al pettenecchio en questa
Passi il pie dritto dopo al stanco e allhora
Dagli un fendente dritto su la testa.
```

```
Similarly being at the half sword again.
Direct a kick to the privates for this
pass the right foot with the _stanco_ and at that time
strike them with a fendente dritto to the head
```

_stanco_ can be translated as tired, bored, exhausted, or standing. I read it as the non-dominant, or trailing foot.

We provoke with the falso while passing forward with our left foot, deliver the kick with the right foot, replace it behind to deliver a mandritto fendente.

### Patiente

```
Il contra e questo senza far dimora
Dandoti il calcio con la penna presta
Del brocchier dagli al schinco fortemente,
Tu pari il calcio, e quel non da il fendente.
```

```
The counter and this do without delay
Giving the kick with the _penna_ they supplied
of the buckler delivered to the shin bones strongly,
You parry the kick, and they can't give the fendente.
```

We strike the leg with the buckler as our opponent tries to kick us in the groin. A noble defense, which allows us to keep our sword free to either parry the fendente or, if it isn't thrown, to riposte.

### Agente

```
Se la stretta e col pie sinistro inanzi
Passa col destro e darli un falso fingi
Accio chel tuo nimico a ingegno avanzi.
La spada drieto al capo fa gli attingi
Fa chel pie manco tuo al suo dritto danzi
alla la fina stanca il capo i spingi
la man dritta gli ficca fra le cosse
trabaccaratti drieto se Hercul fosse.
```

```
You are crossed with left foot forward
Pass with right and deliver a falso feignt
for the purpose that your foe thinks they have the advantage.
The sword (back, behind, along) to the head they draw
make your left foot to their right dance
to as far as their left foot, thrust the head
the right arm and shove them
tumbling back if Hercul goes.
```

We throw a similar falso feight to stretta i. while passing obliquely to our right, expecting our opponent to begin throwing the reverso as the counter. If they draw their hand back to throw the blow, we step back in as far as their left leg, shoving their arm to their head.

### Patiente

```
Capo Tondo Contra
Il contra e questo quando il singe darti
Il falso non te movere a tal vista
Quando il getta la spada per ficcarti
Il capo alla lasina farai trista
sua vira se gran passo puoi tirarti
dopo al pie stanco il destro e fa tu invista
cioe in spada in armi poi un reverso mena.
ne puoi fallir che tu non gli dia pena.
```

```
Head tondo counter
The counter and this that it alone you strike
the falso not moving to such sight.
When they throw the sword to get you
the head to therein, make them mourn
their turn a great step can draw
with the left foot to the right and cover yourself,
rather, bring the sword to ready (then, future action) a reverso strike
you cannot fail when you are not given pain.
```

We deflect the provocation by going to reverse head guard, without moving our feet, and when the hand comes in to push our arm, we pull our left foot and body back and strike a reverso tondo. This is likely an oblique pass back.

<summary>Quarta Stretta</summary>

### Agente

```
Quarta Stretta
Item al volto/ cioe nel polso stanco
Fingi di dare un falso en questo fare
Lascia piover la spada in atto franco
Di molinetto e fa il pie stanco andare
Verso il suo destro e in cio non esser maco.
Anzi un reverso spinto babbi en menare
ne la sua tempia dritta. Al contra attendi,
Accioche anchor da questo te deffendi.
```

```
Fourth crossing
In the same way the turn / That is in pushed left
Feight of granting a falso this do
Let the sword fall freely down
of molinetto and do the left foot enter
towards their right and in that don't be (bruised?).
Also a pushed reverso (savage|with guile) to hit
in their right temple. The counter expected,
that another in this you defend.
```

Here, we perform a falso feight to their right temple, as above, in this case bringing our left foot obliquely to their right. Using the force of their parry, we perform a _molinetto_ to cut around to their outside, pushing our reverso to their head while covering the line, expecting the reverso as they pass back.

### Patiente

```
Contra
Quando il dimostrara il falso menare
serra la spada insieme col brocchiero.
Mentre chel passa col stanco per dare
a te in la tempia quel reverso fiero.
Il tuo pie stanco alquanto fa passare
dopo dal dritto e in tanto su mainiero
in acro guarda de intrar con un falso/
el suo reverso a lui non sera valso.
```

```
Counter
When they display the falso
clamp the sword together with buckler.
While that pass of left about to hit
at you in the temple with the proud reverso.
Your left leg (small quantity) passes
with somewhat right and in so many is (manageable / gentle)
in (a?to) guarda de intrare with a falso
their reverso will for then not will be fruitful
```

When the falso comes in, we parry in reverse head guard similarly. When they throw the reverso, expecting us to step back, we close the line with a standard shuffle forward into guardia de inrare, thrusting to the chest.

v. Stretta
Hor oltra tu farai di pugno voltà
Sopra la man di la sua spada dentro,
La man gli affondarai tu questa volta
E gli darai nel collo un falso dentro.
```

```
Fifth crossing
With forward movement you do a punch, turn
over the inside of the hand of their sword,
you plunge the hand with a turn
and strike them in the neck a falso inside.
```

We use the same false edge provocation, this time striking the hilt of our sword into the hilt of their sword, and thrusting our pommel to the inside of their arm to hook the wrist, pulling it down to our right hip in an arm bar, and throw a false edge cut to the inside of their neck.

### Patiente

```
Contra
ll contra quando il far del pugno volta,
Quādo il suo braccio dal tuo braccio e detro
Spingi il suo braccio alla tua stanca parte
Toccandol presto e larte inganna larte.

Counter
the counter when they do the punch turn,
when their arm goes to the inside of your arm
shoving their arm to your trailing side,
Touching (obligatory) quickly and the art decieves the art
```

As they come in to hook our hand, we rise to reverse head guard, passing with our left foot and hooking their wrist with our pommel to perform the same intent.

```
Sixth crossing
Pass to their right with your left foot,
with buckler give them in the hand of the sword
and give them to the neck a reverso their right
```

Pass forwards with the left foot while pushing your buckler to their sword hand, possibly with a hilt strike to the sword (similar to v., but no intent to turn the hand and hook) and strike a reverso to the right side of their neck.

### Patiente

```
Contra
Se da questo deffenderte ti aggrada
Quando il fa il passo stanco fa del Maestro
Col taglio del brocchier non stare abbada
Ma dagli entro dal braccio e sera perso

```
Counter
If from this defence they advance on you
when they make the (non-dominant) pass of some master
with edge of the buckler not stay delayed
but strike them with the buckler and they will be lost
such that you prune the reverso.
```

Drive the buckler into their sword hand, which blocks the riverso, and riposting from below

vii. Stretta.
ltem col franco pie passa al suo dritto
Di sotto in su fa un redoppio passando
Per il suo bracci e presto col pie dritto
Al suo sinestro va cossi passando
Da un falso al volto non al lato dritto .
```

```
Seventh crossing
(In the same way | Just like) with trailing foot passing to their right
For under in up do a redoppio going over
by their arm and quickly with right foot
to their left go to cut going over
of a falso to turn to the non dominant side.

```

As above, we step in with the left foot and deflect the sword with buckler and/or sword hilt. We can perform a rising ridoppio reverso as opposed to the descending reverso to the neck, anticipating the buckler strike, and turn a falso cut the left side of their head using the energy with a triangle step.

### Patiente

```
Contra
Lopposito e, mentre chel vien passando
Col pie stanco al redoppio se procaccia
Subito buttate in guarda di faccia.

Voltando il falso per darti alla testa
Butta il pie dritto dopo al stanco un passo
E nel passar fa che habbi la man presta
Dagli un mezzo mandritto con fracasso
Dentro al braccio de la spada e per questa
Botta sera de la vittoria casso .

Attendi ancho al seguēce io vuo insignarte
Il contra e pro pro e contra con bella arte .
```

```
Counter
The interruption and, while they come
with a trailing foot pass to redoppio, protect with
suddenly thrust into guarda di faccia.

Turning the falso to strike to testa
Push the right foot to their trailing foot a step
and pass when having the hand presented
strike them a mezzo mandritto with a crash
in the arm of the sword and with which
thrust would be the triumph (to cross out, to void)

Extend another following, I instruct you
the counter and well may you fare and counter with good art.
```

We go to guardia di faccia while striking their sword with our buckler, and as it turns to a false edge mandritto fendente, we step to their rear foot and cut a falso to testa to catch the falso, before exchanging to our buckler and cutting their forearm with a slice and thrusting a stoccatta as we leave.

The patient goes to parry our falso with their own. We quickly release a reverso from dente di cingaro with a mezza volta to our left foot.

As they cut around from dente di cingaro, turn your falso into a reverso over their left leg, and should you bind, you will be able to push them with a superior structure.
