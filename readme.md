# Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>
This is a work in progress English translation of the sword and buckler plays from Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino. I'm making use of my basic understanding of Italian, various online translation resources, and trying to infer some of the meaning behind some of the more linguistic flourishes in the original text.
If I get something wrong, or if you have a better translation or interpretation for anything included, feel free to submit an issue or a PR.

<summary>Framing</summary>

```
Doue e Franco e compagni il dir mimena,
Che ritrouor Chironne in un boschetto .
Chironne in vista i giudico gagliardi,
Per canto imbraccio il scudo, e prese i dardi.

Domandol nome il tutto gli narrórnoi
E come gli mandaua allui Mercurio
```

```
Doue and Franco and comrades reveal to me,
that Chironne was found in a grove.
With Chironne's insight, I judge them to be nimbly disposed of body,
and so covering well with the shield, and gripping the darts.
I inquired his name, they told me the tale, and how
Mercurio had commanded them to him.
```

This is how the story leads into the section on the sword lessons, establishing Chironne as the fencing instructor and the sons of Minos as the students.

Introduction to the mezza spada
</summary>

```
Disse Chironne, io non faro soggiorno,
Ma ne l'imprese gravi mai non furio.
Voglio ciascun di voi far prima adorno
Nello schermireze, e fieui bono alcurio ,

Che quādo un homo ha grāde arte e possan
Il se puo dir che ogni altro al Modo auáza .
```

```
So says Chironne, I will not follow fashions,
so never undertake these grave matters with fury.
I wish for each of you to be first decent
in fencing, and be fierce, strong, and proud
As when one has good art and might,
they may learn these additional forms.
```

Achiallino states he won't follow the format used by other teachers, and instructs students to take this shit seriously and not to lose their temper.

He also states the plays should be used by a fencer with knowledge and confidence in Bolognese style fencing, which is clear from the lack of explanations of the basic cuts, guards, and terms throughout.

```
Piglia la spada in mano col brocchiero
Leggiadro col pie dritto va in traverso
Dal dritto lato tuo destro еe mainero
Accioche tu non par schermitor perso,
Passando per parer piu vago e fiero/
E far il gioco piu polyco e terso.
Tocca il brocchier col falso di la spada,
E la spada in guarda alta sa che vada.
```

```
Take the sword and buckler in hand
Step with your right foot traversing
to the right side in this manner
Additionally, so you aren't lost in fencing,
Pacing, in my opinion, is most elusive and proud,
and the play will be smooth and polished.
Touch the buckler to the false of the sword,
and your sword in high guard, as you go by.
```

A few important takeaways from this paragraph that Achillino feels are worth mentioning. We're instructed to stand in oblique right foot forward guards, and assured that learning tempo is both difficult and extremely important to polishing our fencing. We are also told to keep our sword in high guards when in presence, and guard the inside of our hand with the buckler.

```
Se dir volesse il gioco a parte a parter
I passi, i colpi, i tocchi, i falsi, i dritti,
lo vergarei ben piu di mille charte.
Basta i secreti grandi io tharro ditci
Quanti ne sono qualı in tutta larrer
Che questi sono stati mei profirti.
Vsanza e а far ire assalti in questo gioco,
Sel ne tocco uno ogniun torni al suo loco .
```

```
To teach the game piece by piece,
from the steps, the touches, the strikes, the false and the true.
I could write well over a thousand papers.
Sufficient great secrets I valiantly tell you.
Largely they are as the whole art.
that these situations you stand to benefit.
Customarily perform the three assaulti to this range,
with their touch each one works around to their side
```

Achillino is reiterating he is not teaching from basics, but is teaching techniques at what is considered the cruicial distance in fencing.

The "three assaulti" refer to the long plays, or flourishes done from the _gioco largo_, though none are in this tretise, but we can assume they are common in the Bolognese tradition. Achillino instructs us to use these to reach the _mezza spada_, then work to find openings from the bind.

```
Le cose de importancia io voglio dire
Ardisco dir chio dico ogni secreto .
Giungendo a mezza spada nel schermire,
Starli in dui modi solo e consuero ,
Fil fallo con fil fallo puo aduenire ,
O fil dritto con dritro, hor giamo driero .
Ciascun eller puo agente e patiente.
Chi fie piu accorto e Maestro fia vincente .
```

```
The things of importance I desire to say:
I dare to tell you every secret
on coming to the half swords in fencing,
Standing in two fashions simple and common.
The false can come to the false,
or the dritto to the dritto, now already behind.
Either one can be the agent or the patient.
Whoever is more aware and masterful will be the victor
```

Finishing up the intro, Achillino tells us the mechanics of playing in the _mezza spada_. We can be crossed at the false edge or at the true edge. Either we or our opponent can act first as the agent, or counter that action as the patient. The last line indicates the most important thing is our situational awareness, which lets us know _which_ technique to employ, and second to be masterful, or practiced, to actually _use_ the techniques.

## Falso con Falso

<details>
	<summary>i. Stretta</summary>

### Agente

```
Se sei falso con falso a mezza spada
Voltagli un falso ne la destra tempia.
El tuo pe destro indieto presto vada
e tra un reverso spinto e sie botta empia.
Sel contra di tal stretta far ti aggrada
```

```
If you are falso on falso at the half sword,
You turn a falso to the right temple.
Quickly pass to your right hand,
and thrust a pushed reverso and it will strike wicked
if the counter of such a stretta pleases you.
```

I read this play as starting in _right coda lunga alta_, throwing a false edge cut to the opponent's face, and should they counter the cut strongly, using the energy from their parry to cut around to _guardia entrare_ on the right, and passing with the left foot to thrust.

Achillino specifies to "thrust a pushed reverso", which I have taken to mean a true edge push-cut with the palm down. Think a very small reverso tondo while extending the hands forward with the whole body behind it.

### Patiente

```
Voltando il falso che chi toglie stempia,
Va col pie dritto al suo dritco e un reverso
Tondo alla drita tempia i da a traverso.
```

```
As the turn of the falso that which distempers
Go with right foot to their right and a reverso
tondo to the right temple given across
```

As the agent turns the false edge to provoke a defensive reaction, step to their outside with the right foot and attack in preparation with a reverso tondo, which crosses back over the line to your right. To get the power required, weight your left foot with a hip turn while bringing the sword to reverse head guard, then strike the tondo while stepping into measure with the right foot and follow with a triangle step back to _right coda lunga alta_.

<summary>ii. Stretta</summary>

### Agente

```
Item essendo a mezza spada anchora
Managli un calcio al pettenecchio en questa
Passi il pie dritto dopo al stanco e allhora
Dagli un fendente dritto su la testa.
```

```
Similarly being at the half sword again.
Direct a kick to the privates for this
pass the right foot behind the _stanco_ and at that time
strike them with a fendente dritto to the head
```

_stanco_ can be translated as tired, bored, exhausted, or standing. I read it as the non-dominant, or trailing foot.

We deliver the kick with the right foot, and pass back while delivering a mandritto fendente, we don't move our left foot.

### Patiente

```
Il contra e questo senza far dimora
Dandoti il calcio con la penna presta
Del brocchier dagli al schinco fortemente,
Tu pari il calcio, e quel non da il fendente.
```

```
The counter and this do without delay
Giving the kick with the _penna_ they supplied
of the buckler delivered to the shin bones strongly,
You parry the kick, and they can't give the fendente.
```

We strike the leg with the buckler as our opponent tries to kick us in the groin. A noble defense, which allows us to keep our sword free to either parry the fendente or, if it isn't thrown, to riposte.

</details>

## Strettas (redo WIP)

Also a technique happening firmly at the half sword.
Deliver a kick to the groin with the right foot following a trailing foot pass
to give a fendente dritto to the head.

#### Contra

The counter is to intercept the target.
To the kick you are owed,
forcefully crash the buckler.
You parry the kick, and they cannot deliver the fendente.

### iii. Stretta

This is the stretta with the left foot forward.
Pass with the right and deliver a feight falso.
Deliver to your enemy a dritto slice to the head, if you've outwitted them.
let your left foot danse to your right,
thrust the edge to the head by pushing a mandritto
between their weapons.
Omit the drieto if Hercul does
the counter like so.

#### Contra

When they pretend to throw the false, do not move at the sight. When they throw the sword to draw the edge on your head, you will make their life sad by taking a great passing step, and following after with the trailing foot. The right one makes you intuitive,
that is, with sword in arms then strike a riverso, nor can you fail if you don't give them pain

### iv. Stretta

Also to the face, that is, in the wrist extension
throw a feint falso to the face,
Let your sword fall with an extended molinetto, bringing the trailing foot well to your right. while throwing a riverso to their right temple in this action. For the counter, wait to defend yourself from this strike.

#### Contra

When they perform the manacing falso,
hold the sword with the buckler
While they pass with the trailing foot
to deliver the prideful riverso
Pass with your trailing foot from the oblique and to their left
and after the dritto portion of their molinetto,
cut them with a falso in guarda inrare,
so their riverso won't continue.

### v. Stretta

In an overleveraged crossing, you will push your fist (buckler?) over the hand on the inside of their sword hand.
You will lower their hand and throw a falso to their neck on the inside

#### Contra

The counter is when they turn the fist,
when their arm goes to the inside of your arm,
shove their arm to your outside
To react quickly with the technique cheats the technique.


### vi. Stretta

Pass to their right with your left foot with the buckler delivered to the sword hand and deliver a riverso to their right.

#### Contra

If defending yourself from this offense, when they step to you with their trailing foot and the cut of the buckler, do not fear the beat, but enter the inside of the arm to escape and they will not be able to give you the riverso

### vii. Stretta

Another with the trailing foot passing to their right. From below, cut a ridoppio through their right hand and quickly step with the right to their left side, and cut their face with a falso on the non dominant side.
#### Contra

To oppose this, as they come passing with the trailing foot with the ridoppio, immediately throw yourself to guardia di faccia.

When the turn of the falso to your head is committed, and the right foot is a step beyond the trailing foot, immediately deliver a mezzo mandritto with force to the inside of the sword arm and with this seize the moment of victory from them

Wait for the subsequent as I taught you. Counter properly and counter artfully.

### viii. Stretta

If the right foot has been committed elsewhere, thrust your buckler arm over the inside of theirs and pull it to your right and you will quickly know to pass to make your gambit strong.

#### Contra

Do this in place and prove yourself wise. When they force their left arm over your right and press with force,
note how they are forcing you to turn your back.

### ix Stretta

In their gap,give them a falso fendente to the head while taking a great step with your right foot to their left. Quickly deliver a 
 riverso to their right temple during your exit.

 ### Contra

Do not rest in place, do the opposite motion and counter firmly and quickly by giving them a ridoppio with the falso, combined with a full mandritto fendente.
