# Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>
This is a work in progress English translation of the sword and buckler plays from Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino. I'm making use of my basic understanding of Italian, various online translation resources, and trying to infer some of the meaning behind some of the more linguistic flourishes in the original text.
If I get something wrong, or if you have a better translation or interpretation for anything included, feel free to submit an issue or a PR.

<summary>Framing</summary>

```
Doue e Franco e compagni il dir mimena,
Che ritrouor Chironne in un boschetto .
Chironne in vista i giudico gagliardi,
Per canto imbraccio il scudo, e prese i dardi.

Domandol nome il tutto gli narrórnoi
E come gli mandaua allui Mercurio
```

```
Doue and Franco and comrades reveal to me,
that Chironne was found in a grove.
With Chironne's insight, I judge them to be nimbly disposed of body,
and so covering well with the shield, and gripping the darts.
I inquired his name, they told me the tale, and how
Mercurio had commanded them to him.
```

This is how the story leads into the section on the sword lessons, establishing Chironne as the fencing instructor and the sons of Minos as the students. Some sections are written in second person, and some in third, all from Chironne's voice.

Introduction to the mezza spada
</summary>

```
Disse Chironne, io non faro soggiorno,
Ma ne l'imprese gravi mai non furio.
Voglio ciascun di voi far prima adorno
Nello schermireze, e fieui bono alcurio ,

Che quādo un homo ha grāde arte e possan
Il se puo dir che ogni altro al Modo auáza .
```

```
So says Chironne, I will not follow fashions,
so never undertake these grave matters with fury.
I wish for each of you to be first decent
in fencing, and be fierce, strong, and proud
As when one has good art and might,
they may learn these additional forms.
```

Achiallino states he won't follow the format used by other teachers or teach hot headed pupils. Seems fair.

He also states the plays should be used by a fencer with knowledge and confidence in Bolognese style fencing, which is clear from the lack of explanations of the basic cuts, guards, and terms throughout.

```
Piglia la spada in mano col brocchiero
Leggiadro col pie dritto va in traverso
Dal dritto lato tuo destro еe mainero
Accioche tu non par schermitor perso,
Passando per parer piu vago e fiero/
E far il gioco piu polyco e terso.
Tocca il brocchier col falso di la spada,
E la spada in guarda alta sa che vada.
```

```
Take the sword and buckler in hand
Step with your right foot traversing
to the right side in this manner
Additionally, so you aren't lost in fencing,
Pacing, in my opinion, is most elusive and proud,
and the play will be smooth and polished.
Touch the buckler to the false of the sword,
and your sword in high guard, as you go by.
```

A few important takeaways from this paragraph that Achillino feels are worth mentioning. We're instructed to stand in oblique right foot forward guards, and assured that learning tempo is both difficult and extremely important to polishing our fencing. We are also told to keep our sword in high guards when in presence, and guard the inside of our hand with the buckler.

```
Se dir volesse il gioco a parte a parter
I passi, i colpi, i tocchi, i falsi, i dritti,
lo vergarei ben piu di mille charte.
Basta i secreti grandi io tharro ditci
Quanti ne sono qualı in tutta larrer
Che questi sono stati mei profirti.
Vsanza e а far ire assalti in questo gioco,
Sel ne tocco uno ogniun torni al suo loco .
```

```
To teach the game piece by piece,
from the steps, the touches, the strikes, the false and the true.
I could write well over a thousand papers.
Sufficient great secrets I valiantly tell you.
Many of which share similarities with the full art.
That these are situations you are benefiting.
Customarily perform the three assaulti to this range,
with their touch each one works around to their side
```

Achillino is reiterating he is not teaching the full art, but is teaching some techniques that work in specific situations that build on existing knowledge of fencing.

The "three assaulti" could mean either some plays similar to those seen in Manciolino or Morozzo, though none are in this tretise, or the three methods of attacking an enemy, being mandritti, roversi, or thrusts. In either case, Achillino says those work until the situation where we are in _mezza spada_ and have to work around our opponent's sword, where we must perform some more specialized techniques.

```
Le cose de importancia io voglio dire
Ardisco dir chio dico ogni secreto .
Giungendo a mezza spada nel schermire,
Starli in dui modi solo e consuero ,
Fil fallo con fil fallo puo aduenire ,
O fil dritto con dritro, hor giamo driero .
Ciascun eller puo agentere patiente.
Chi fie piu accorto e Maestro fia vincente .
```

```
The things of importance I desire to say:
I dare to tell you every secret
on coming to the half swords in fencing,
Standing in two fashions simple and common.
The false can come to the false,
or the dritto to the dritto, now already behind.
Either one can be the agent or the patient.
Whoever is more shrewd and masterful will be the victor
```

Finishing up the intro, Achillino tells us the mechanics of playing in the _mezza spada_. We can be crossed at the false edge or at the true edge. Either we or our opponent can act first as the agent, or counter that action as the patient, as we should have equal _tempo_, and technique is the only thing that matters in this situation, rather than strength or speed.

## Strettas (redo WIP)


### i. Stretta a mezza spada

If you are falso on falso at the half sword
turn a falso to their right temple,
step with your right foot indirectly to the inside and quickly push a riverso with a cruel blow (a suppression?)

#### Contra
The counter to this stretta for your pleasure:
When they turn the falso to catch the temple,
step with your right foot directly to their right and throw a riverso tondo to their right temple from across

### ii. Stretta

Also a technique happening firmly at the half sword.
Deliver a kick to the groin with the right foot following a trailing foot pass
to give a fendente dritto to the head.

#### Contra

The counter is to intercept the target.
To the kick you are owed,
forcefully crash the buckler.
You parry the kick, and they cannot deliver the fendente.

### iii. Stretta

This is the stretta with the left foot forward.
Pass with the right and deliver a feight falso.
Deliver to your enemy a dritto slice to the head, if you've outwitted them.
let your left foot danse to your right,
thrust the edge to the head by pushing a mandritto
between their weapons.
Omit the drieto if Hercul does
the counter like so.

#### Contra

When they pretend to throw the false, do not move at the sight. When they throw the sword to draw the edge on your head, you will make their life sad by taking a great passing step, and following after with the trailing foot. The right one makes you intuitive,
that is, with sword in arms then strike a riverso, nor can you fail if you don't give them pain

### iv. Stretta

Also to the face, that is, in the wrist extension
throw a feint falso to the face,
Let your sword fall with an extended molinetto, bringing the trailing foot well to your right. while throwing a riverso to their right temple in this action. For the counter, wait to defend yourself from this strike.

#### Contra

When they perform the manacing falso,
hold the sword with the buckler
While they pass with the trailing foot
to deliver the prideful riverso
Pass with your trailing foot from the oblique and to their left
and after the dritto portion of their molinetto,
cut them with a falso in guarda inrare,
so their riverso won't continue.

### v. Stretta

In an overleveraged crossing, you will push your fist (buckler?) over the hand on the inside of their sword hand.
You will lower their hand and throw a falso to their neck on the inside

#### Contra

The counter is when they turn the fist,
when their arm goes to the inside of your arm,
shove their arm to your outside
To react quickly with the technique cheats the technique.


### vi. Stretta

Pass to their right with your left foot with the buckler delivered to the sword hand and deliver a riverso to their right.

#### Contra

If defending yourself from this offense, when they step to you with their trailing foot and the cut of the buckler, do not fear the beat, but enter the inside of the arm to escape and they will not be able to give you the riverso

### vii. Stretta

Another with the trailing foot passing to their right. From below, cut a ridoppio through their right hand and quickly step with the right to their left side, and cut their face with a falso on the non dominant side.
#### Contra

To oppose this, as they come passing with the trailing foot with the ridoppio, immediately throw yourself to guardia di faccia.

When the turn of the falso to your head is committed, and the right foot is a step beyond the trailing foot, immediately deliver a mezzo mandritto with force to the inside of the sword arm and with this seize the moment of victory from them

Wait for the subsequent as I taught you. Counter properly and counter artfully.

### viii. Stretta

If the right foot has been committed elsewhere, thrust your buckler arm over the inside of theirs and pull it to your right and you will quickly know to pass to make your gambit strong.

#### Contra

Do this in place and prove yourself wise. When they force their left arm over your right and press with force,
note how they are forcing you to turn your back.

### ix Stretta

In their gap,give them a falso fendente to the head while taking a great step with your right foot to their left. Quickly deliver a 
 riverso to their right temple during your exit.

 ### Contra

Do not rest in place, do the opposite motion and counter firmly and quickly by giving them a ridoppio with the falso, combined with a full mandritto fendente.
