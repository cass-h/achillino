# Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino

## Notes

This is a work in progress English translation of the sword and buckler plays from Viridario de Gioanne Philotheo Achillino. I'm making use of my basic understanding of Italian, various online translation resources, and trying to infer some of the meaning behind some of the more linguistic flourishes in the original text.

If I get something wrong, or if you have a better translation or interpretation for anything included, feel free to submit an issue or a PR.

## Charron:

I will not make light, for I've not been in this gravest of undertakings. I wish for each of you to be first decent in fencing, and to have good art. As when one has good art and guards, they may learn the methods of all others.

Take the sword and buckler in hand with a graceful step of your right foot across to your right side.
So that you aren't lost in fencing, step elusively and fiercely, and the play will be clean and clear.

Touch the buckler to the false of the sword,
and your sword in a high guard, knowing its worth.

To teach the game component by component, from the steps, the touches, the strikes, the false and the true. I could write well over a thousand journals. Suffice to say, I've found the great many secrets I write herein on this full art to be beneficial.

It is customary to make three assaults in this game. If one is touched, they return to their place.

The things of importance I desire to say: I dare to tell you every secret on coming to the half swords in fencing,
standing in both simple and common ways.
The false to the false can happen,
or the dritto to the dritto or _gliamo dritto_.
Either one can be the agent or the patient.
Whoever is more shrewd and masterful will be the victor

### i. Stretta a mezza spada

If you are falso on falso at the half sword
turn a falso to their right temple,
step with your right foot indirectly to the inside and quickly push a riverso with a cruel blow (a suppression?)

#### Contra
The counter to this stretta for your pleasure:
When they turn the falso to catch the temple,
step with your right foot directly to their right and throw a riverso tondo to their right temple from across

### ii. Stretta

Also a technique happening firmly at the half sword.
Deliver a kick to the groin with the right foot following a trailing foot pass
to give a fendente dritto to the head.

#### Contra

The counter is to intercept the target.
To the kick you are owed,
forcefully crash the buckler.
You parry the kick, and they cannot deliver the fendente.

### iii. Stretta

This is the stretta with the left foot forward.
Pass with the right and deliver a feight falso.
Deliver to your enemy a dritto slice to the head, if you've outwitted them.
let your left foot danse to your right,
thrust the edge to the head by pushing a mandritto
between their weapons.
Omit the drieto if Hercul does
the counter like so.

#### Contra

When they pretend to throw the false, do not move at the sight. When they throw the sword to draw the edge on your head, you will make their life sad by taking a great passing step, and following after with the trailing foot. The right one makes you intuitive,
that is, with sword in arms then strike a riverso, nor can you fail if you don't give them pain

### iv. Stretta

Also to the face, that is, in the wrist extension
throw a feint falso to the face,
Let your sword fall with an extended molinetto, bringing the trailing foot well to your right. while throwing a riverso to their right temple in this action. For the counter, wait to defend yourself from this strike.

#### Contra

When they perform the manacing falso,
hold the sword with the buckler
While they pass with the trailing foot
to deliver the prideful riverso
Pass with your trailing foot from the oblique and to their left
and after the dritto portion of their molinetto,
cut them with a falso in guarda inrare,
so their riverso won't continue.

### v. Stretta

In an overleveraged crossing, you will push your fist (buckler?) over the hand on the inside of their sword hand.
You will lower their hand and throw a falso to their neck on the inside

#### Contra

The counter is when they turn the fist,
when their arm goes to the inside of your arm,
shove their arm to your outside
To react quickly with the technique cheats the technique.


### vi. Stretta

Pass to their right with your left foot with the buckler delivered to the sword hand and deliver a riverso to their right.

#### Contra

If defending yourself from this offense, when they step to you with their trailing foot and the cut of the buckler, do not fear the beat, but enter the inside of the arm to escape and they will not be able to give you the riverso

### vii. Stretta

Another with the trailing foot passing to their right. From below, cut a ridoppio through their right hand and quickly step with the right to their left side, and cut their face with a falso on the non dominant side.
#### Contra

To oppose this, as they come passing with the trailing foot with the ridoppio, immediately throw yourself to guardia di faccia.

When the turn of the falso to your head is committed, and the right foot is a step beyond the trailing foot, immediately deliver a mezzo mandritto with force to the inside of the sword arm and with this seize the moment of victory from them

Wait for the subsequent as I taught you. Counter properly and counter artfully.

### viii. Stretta

If the right foot has been committed elsewhere, thrust your buckler arm over the inside of theirs and pull it to your right and you will quickly know to pass to make your gambit strong.

#### Contra

Do this in place and prove yourself wise. When they force their left arm over your right and press with force,
note how they are forcing you to turn your back.

### ix Stretta

In their gap,give them a falso fendente to the head while taking a great step with your right foot to their left. Quickly deliver a 
 riverso to their right temple during your exit.

 ### Contra

Do not rest in place, do the opposite motion and counter firmly and quickly by giving them a ridoppio with the falso, combined with a full mandritto fendente.
